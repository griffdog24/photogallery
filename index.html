							<h2>Slanted Arches Under Moss Art Center Entrance</h2>
							<p>The Moss Art Center holds most of the upper level classes for students in the school of liberal arts. It has music halls, film rooms, etc. Therefore it makes sense for the building to be the most unique looking building on campus, with slanted arches, different colored windows, and strange shapes.</p>
